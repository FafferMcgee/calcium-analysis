#' A function used to quantify the response in the region of interest normalized by F/Fo.
#'
#' It normalizes the intensity data during stimulus window by calculating an average Fo before stimulus, and then dviding the fluorescence values in this window by the background Fo.
#'
#' After this normalization, it looks for the maximum value in the same stimulus window and outputs this value as the 'response'.
#'
#' Normalizing first by an averaged background (Fo) right before stimulus corrects for photobleaching/drift.
